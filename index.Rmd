We model a decision impact pathway of  RA VBA  (Whitney et al. 2025).

**Conceptual model of RA VBA**

# Urban Hanoi school garden 

Simulation of  RA VBA:

```{r mcsimulation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Source our model
source("vba_model_kenya.R")

```

The Net Present Value (i.e. current value of the future benefits) of the garden decision options over `r simulation_results$x$number_of_years[1]` years of the intervention. For public and private schools the STEM costs are considered to be in the same garden space but with the additional costs and benefits of a full STEM education program. All options are compared to the same years of using the land for something that is not related to the garden, i.e. as a playground or for parking. Here we plot the distribution for the decision and frame the projected NPV. 

For public schools:

```{r plot_dist_public, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("functions/plot_distributions.R")
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = simulation_results, 
                                    vars = "NPV_Comparative",
                   old_names = "NPV_Comparative",
                   new_names = "Gains compared to the baseline",
                                    method = 'smooth_simple_overlay', 
                                    base_size = 7, 
                                    x_axis_name = "Comparative NPV outcomes")
```
